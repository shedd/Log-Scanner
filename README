Log Scanner

A simple utility that I created to scan a bunch of different log files and alert me if any error messages or warnings occurred that I needed to be aware of.  While most systems have their own error detection and alert code built in, we had a bunch of utilities running that needed to be monitored.  So, I ran this script via cron to grep the files and alert my team via email if issues occurred that needed to be attended to.


To Dos:
- Update the script to ignore repeat errors (i.e. if the error is the same as it was on the last run, consider the team alerted and don't spam them)


Config:
At the top of the script, you'll find the variables that need configuration:

//send alert emails to this address
$alert_email_to = "user@domain.com"; //this is the email you want to be alerted at. setup a mailing list under your Google Apps account to alert your team

//define list of errors to search for
$errors = array("Warning","Fatal error");//this list is good for PHP errors/warnings

//define list of files to search
$files = array("errors/log1.log","errors/log2.log"); //comma separated list of files to rep

//folder that holds the log files
$base_path = "/path/to/files/"; //the folder holding the log files


Usage:
I ran this via cron (using lockrun of course):

*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/lockrun --lockfile=/path/log_alert.lockrun -- sh -c "/usr/bin/php /path/log_alert.php > /path/log_alert.log"
